        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate Fashion and Design student, eager to transform ideas into beautiful creations. My love for fashion is inspired by vibrant colors, textures, and the stories that clothing tells. Whether itâ€™s designing a chic outfit or exploring the latest trends, my creativity knows no bounds.</p>
        <p>My focus is not only on aesthetics but also on the cultural narratives behind fashion. I believe that every piece of clothing has a story and contributes to our identity. My goal is to merge traditional craftsmanship with modern techniques, creating pieces that celebrate diversity and individuality.</p>
